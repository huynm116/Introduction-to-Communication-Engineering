Phase Shift Keying (PSK) is a digital modulation technique that transmits the data nthrough changes in the phase of a carrier signal. It is a popular method of communication because of its robustness against noise and its ability to transmit data at high rates. PSK is used in various applications such as radio and satellite communication, wireless communication, and digital audio broadcasting. The main advantage of PSK is that it requires a smaller bandwidth than amplitude shift keying (ASK) or frequency shift keying (FSK) because it encodes the information in the phase rather than the amplitude of frequency. In this report, we will perform the PSK modulation and demodulation of a random binary signal and analyze the performance of the PSK system with and without the effects of additive white Gaussian noise.

1. Perform the PSK Modulation:
- Generating and Plotting the Carrier Signals: The first step in PSK modulation is to generate the carrier signals. The carrier signals are cosine waves with a phase usually of either 0 or pi. But because of the immunity to noise when choosing the phase to be 0 and pi, I will illustrate the bit error probability with the phase of 0 and pi/6. If the binary data is 0, the carrier signal is cos(2pift), and if the carrier signal is 1, the carrier signal is cos(2pift + pi/6), where f is the frequency of carrier signal and t is the time. These carrier signals are then plotted to visualize the waveform.

- Generating and Plotting the Binary Data Sequence: The next step is to generate a random binary data sequence. In this case, the binary data sequence will consist of 1s and 0s, where 1 represents a positive phase shift and 0 represents a negative phase shift. The binary data sequence is then plotted to visualize the pattern of data.

- Performing PSK Modulation and Plotting the PSK Modulated Signal: The final step is to perform the PSK modulation of the binary data sequence using the carrier signals. The PSK modulated signal is generated by multiplying the binary data sequence with the carrier signals. The PSK modulated signal is then plotted to visualize the waveform with the help of matplotlib library.

2. Perform the PSK Demodulation: The method in PSK demodulation is to correlate the PSK modulated signal with the carrier signals. The purpose of correlation is to generate decision variables that will be used to determine the demodulated binary data. The correlation is performed using the Maximum Likelihood Criterion, which is a mathematical method that determines the most likely value of the demodulated binary data based on the PSK modulated signal and the carrier signals. This will define whether the demodulated binary data is 0 or 1.


3. Investigate the PSK Modulation/Demodulation under the Effects of Gaussian Noise: Gaussian noise is a type of random noise that is commonly present in communication systems. It is characterized by a zero mean and a variance of N0/2. The noise is added to the transmitted waveform as r(t) = s(t) + n(t), where s(t) is the transmitted waveform and n(t) is the Gaussian noise.

4. Numerically Compute the Error Probability: The error probability is calculated by comparing the original binary dasta sequence with the demodulated binary data. The number of difference bits between the input and output bits divided by the length of input bits represent the error probability.
